# HeliRetextures
## DayZ SIBNIC Helicopter Retextures

These are some Helicopter Retextures I've done for Nightwolfs Helicopters. Feel free to download the Pbo and pack away!
Currently they are all retextured Police Helis. Five in total. Red camo, blacked out admin, ice blue, green camo, and the pink skull.

## Things To Note 

##### Once you have loaded the server with the pbo, it will create new .json files (for the newly added helicopters) in your server config folder.
##### Youll need to change "c_camDistance" From 10.0, to 15.0 in the appropriate heli json. Otherwise in third person its tight close to the tail.
